## Requirements

`npm install -g grunt-cli` and `npm install grunt --save-dev` and `npm install`

## Running Grunt Tests

Run `grunt test`

## Running the app

The script accepts a game board in the form of a 2 dimensional array with a least 2 elements in each row.

Run the script with `node game/app.js [board]` or just `npm start`. If you run node game/app.js you could use the example:
```
node game/app.js [[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,1],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]
```
